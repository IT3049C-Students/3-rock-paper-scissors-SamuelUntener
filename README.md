## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 does your team deserve on this assignment. Revise the assignment grading guideline and assignment rubrics for guidance.

I believe that I deserve 14/20 on this assignment. I completed everything except for the updategamehistoryUI and updatescorehistoryUI.
I tried to learn how to do these things, but I could not figure it out. (I still can't get the tests to work properly)

## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?

I smoothly went through this project until the end where there was little help in the comments.

### How long it took us to finish this?

4 hours and 2 hours of research
